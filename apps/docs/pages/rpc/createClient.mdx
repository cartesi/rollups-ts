# createClient

A new JSON-RPC client can be created using the `createClient` constructor by simply providing the `uri` of the server.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/rpc/createClient.ts]
```

The above `uri` is the default value for a local development execution environment provided by the Cartesi CLI.
